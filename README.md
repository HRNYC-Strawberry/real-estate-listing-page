> Proxy Server For StreetEasy Style Item Listing Page

This project contains the source for a single listing page inspired by the New York City real estate website StreetEasy.com

In this probject, a team of developers contributed components which make up the full page. Each component works on it's own as complete fullstack application and this proxy server combines each component into a complete listing page in the style of a microservice architecture.

I worked on the image carousel component, to view that project's repo visit the link below.
